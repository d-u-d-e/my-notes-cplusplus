# C++ Templates The Complete Guide - D. Vandevoorde, N. Josuttis, D. Gregor (covers C++17)

## Chapter 1: Function Templates

1) Templates are “compiled” in two phases: 1) without instantiation at **definition time**, the template code itself is checked for correctness ignoring the template parameters: for example static assertions that don't depend on template parameters are checked. 2)  At **instantiation time**, the template code is checked (again) to ensure that all code is valid. That is, now especially, all parts that depend on template parameters are double-checked.

2) When declaring call parameters by reference, even trivial conversions do not apply to type deduction. When declaring call parameters by value, only trivial conversions that decay are supported: Qualifications with `const` or `volatile` are ignored, references convert to the referenced type, and raw arrays or functions convert to the corresponding pointer type. For two arguments declared with the same template parameter `T` the decayed types must match. Type deduction does not work for default call arguments: you must specify a default template type as well.

3) Template argument deduction does not take return types into account. The use of `auto` for the return type without a corresponding trailing return type (which would be introduced with a `->` at the end) indicates that the actual return type must be deduced from the return statements in the function body. Note that an initialization of type `auto` always decays. This also applies to return values when the return type is just `auto` (i.e. there is no trailing return type). A way to write the max template using the trailing return type is:
    ```c++
    template<typename T1, typename T2>
    auto max (T1 a, T2 b) -> typename std::decay<decltype(true?a:b)>::type
    {
        return b < a ? a : b;
    }
    ```
    Note the use of `decay`, because the result of `decltype` could be a reference. Only since C++14 it is possible to let the compiler determine the return type without making the implementation (as above) part of its declaration.

4) Since C++11, the C++ standard library provides a means to specify choosing “the more general type.”`std::common_type<>::type` yields the “common type” of two (or more) different types passed as template arguments.  It decays. `std::common_type_t<T1, T2>` is available from C++14. The above `max` can be implemented by returing the common type of `T1` and `T2`.

5) Like ordinary functions, function templates can be overloaded. A nontemplate function can coexist with a function template that has the same name and can be instantiated with the same type. All other factors being equal, the overload resolution process prefers the nontemplate over one generated from the template. If the template can generate a function with a better match, however, then the template is selected. Recall that with template argument deduction, conversions are not possibile, so the compiler would choose a non template function if available.

## Chapter 2: Class Templates

1) Inside a class template using the class name not followed by template arguments represents the class with its template parameters as its arguments.

2) Unlike nontemplate classes, you can’t declare or define class templates inside functions or block scope. In general, templates can only be defined in global/namespace scope or inside class declarations.

3) Until C++17 you must always specify the template arguments
explicitly. C++17 introduced CTAD, which allows skipping template arguments if they can be derived from the constructor.

4) When passing arguments of a template type T by reference,
the parameter doesn’t decay. So a C string would not decay to a pointer, but remain an array of fixed length.

5) You can define specific deduction guides to provide additional or fix existing class template argument deductions.

## Chapter 3: Nontype Template Parameters

1) With C++17 NTTP can be only constant integral values (including enumerations), pointers to objects/functions/members, lvalue references to objects or functions, or `std::nullptr_t`. This has been relaxed with C++20. Since C++17, you can define a nontype template parameter to generically accept any type that is allowed for a nontype parameter, by using `auto`.

2) Since C++17 even static locally declared string literals can be passed as non type template args. Note that you cannot pass string literals.

## Chapter 4: Variadic Templates
